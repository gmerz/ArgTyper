# ArgTyper

**-- ArgumentParser on Typehints and Decorators**


ArgTyper let's you build command line applications from python functions.
It is similar to [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) (which has more
features), Contrary to Typer, which is based on [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/),
ArgTyper is based on standard argparse.ArgumentParser (for better or for
worse).
